# Prior Art Research — Agent Coordination Protocols (2023-2026)

Research conducted via OpenAI o4-mini with web search, 2026-02-01.

## Key Protocols

### A2A (Agent2Agent) — Google → Linux Foundation
- JSON-RPC 2.0 based, Apache 2.0
- Agent Cards for capability discovery
- Sync, streaming (SSE), and async modes
- OAuth 2/OIDC for auth
- SDKs: Python, Go, JS, Java, .NET
- https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A

### ANP (Agent Network Protocol)
- Three-layer: identity (DID), meta-protocol (negotiation), application (capabilities)
- DID-WBA for identity, ES256K signatures
- DHT/crawler-based discovery
- JSON-RPC interactions
- Reference SDK: AgentConnect (Python)
- https://github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentNetworkProtocol

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) — Anthropic
- JSON-RPC 2.0, tool-use focused
- Widely adopted (OpenAI, Google, Cloudflare)
- More about agent-to-tool than agent-to-agent

### DIDComm v2 — W3C
- Peer-to-peer messaging with DIDs
- E2E encryption, key rotation, forward secrecy
- Production implementations: Aries (Python, Go, JS, .NET)

### ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) — BeeAI → merged into A2A
- RESTful, OpenAPI-defined
- Agent manifests, runs, multimodal messages
- Archived, merged into A2A ecosystem

### FIPA ACL / SPADE
- Legacy but still maintained (JADE 4.6.0, SPADE 4.x)
- SPADE: Python, asyncio, XMPP transport

## Implications for Agora

The space is active. A2A and ANP are the closest to our vision. Key questions:
1. Do we build on A2A/ANP or build fresh?
2. What do they NOT solve that Agora should?
3. Is the gap about protocol or about philosophy (human observability, information containment)?
